# SentimentAnalysis

## Requirements: Anaconda, Spyder (Python v2.7)

## Description:
For this project, we had to read through numerous dialogues script of a Tv-Series and decide if the each episode will create a positive, negative or neutral attitude towards the viewers. For the purpose of this project I was given a sentiment lexicon file. This file had words with their lexicon value ranging from -1 to +1. The word from -1.0 to -0.1 were considered negative where as from +0.1 to +1.0 were considered positive and 0.0 as neutral value. The program mostly dealt with creating and filtering the text of each episode dialogues. The words acquired was crossed checked with the words from sentiment lexicon to receive the lexicon value. These values were then plotted in a bar graph under X-axis with indices [Negative, W. Negative, Neutral, W. Positive and Positive]. This was done to give a visual presentation of the data.
